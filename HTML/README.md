# Topic: HTML Basic Programs 
# Body:
o HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is not a programming language.  
o It is a markup language.   
o True programming languages have the ability to describe logic. HTML, however, is used to display and format parts of a webpage.   
o It is strictly presentational.

# Tag syntax   
o HTML marks up content with HTML ‘tags’.  
o HTML tags are the basic building blocks of all web pages.  
o Essentially, they format the way that information and text is displayed.   
o They put the content into categories (called elements!) such as ‘heading’, ‘paragraph’, and ‘table’.  
o A basic HTML tag consists of a name enclosed within ‘angle brackets’ i.e., less than and greater than symbols.  
o Also, these tags usually come in pairs of opening and closing tags.   
o The closing tag is the same as the opening tag except that the closing tag has a forward slash after the less-than symbol.   

# HTML comments   
o HTML Comments look like <!-- Comment --> and the browser ignores them;  
o you can just put them there for yourself or for others who might look at your HTML document!

# Tag attributes 
o All HTML tags can have ‘attributes’ which provide more information about a certain element.  
o Attributes are always placed in the opening tag of an element and exist as key/value pairs.  
o The values are always in quotes (they can be double or single, but they’re usually double).
